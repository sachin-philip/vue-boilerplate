# Vue Boilerplate

The project is an alternative for vue-cli more focused on build configuration along with vue-router. Vue-cli is one of the best bundling settings ever, Idea of this project is to improve the user understanding of the underhood working of the bundling process in depth.

Following are the build configuration included in this project.

  - webpack `webpack.config.js`
    - sass-loader
    - css-loader
    - IgnorePlugin like `locale`, `moment`
  - babel `.babelrc`
  - eslint `.eslint`
    - Airbnb Standard


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm start

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

*Thanks*
